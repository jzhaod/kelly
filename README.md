# Kelly Criterion Portfolio Allocation

This repository contains tools for applying the Kelly Criterion to stock portfolio allocation. The Kelly Criterion is a formula that determines the optimal position sizing to maximize the logarithm of wealth over the long term.

## Overview

The Kelly Criterion for investments can be expressed as:

```
f* = (p - q) / odds = (edge / odds)
```

Which for stocks translates to:

```
f* = (expected_return - risk_free_rate) / volatilityÂ²
```

For a multi-asset portfolio with correlations, the formula becomes more complex and involves matrix operations.

## Features

- **Basic Kelly Allocation**: Calculate optimal allocation percentages for multiple stocks
- **Fractional Kelly**: Implement Three-Quarter, Half, and Quarter Kelly approaches for different risk levels
- **Advanced Kelly**: Account for correlations between assets (requires matrix operations)
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize allocations, risk-return relationships, and correlations
- **Portfolio Simulation**: Run Monte Carlo simulations to project potential portfolio performance

## Files in this Repository

- `kelly_criterion.js`: Simple implementation of Kelly Criterion for multiple assets
- `advanced_kelly.js`: Advanced implementation considering correlations between assets
- `visualization.js`: Tools for visualizing allocations and portfolio metrics
- `index.js`: Examples showing how to use the various modules
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Import the module
const { calculateKellyAllocation, printAllocations } = require('./kelly_criterion');

// Define your investment universe
const expectedReturns = {
  'TSLA': 0.15, // 15% expected annual return
  'NVDA': 0.25, // 25% expected annual return
  'CPNG': 0.12, // 12% expected annual return
  'SHOP': 0.18, // 18% expected annual return
  'MELI': 0.20  // 20% expected annual return
};

// Volatility (standard deviation of returns)
const volatility = {
  'TSLA': 0.55, // 55% annual volatility
  'NVDA': 0.45, // 45% annual volatility
  'CPNG': 0.40, // 40% annual volatility
  'SHOP': 0.50, // 50% annual volatility
  'MELI': 0.45  // 45% annual volatility
};

// Risk-free rate and portfolio size
const riskFreeRate = 0.045; // 4.5%
const portfolioSize = 1000; // $1000 total investment

// Calculate Kelly allocations
const allocations = calculateKellyAllocation(
  expectedReturns,
  volatility,
  riskFreeRate,
  portfolioSize
);

// Print allocation results
printAllocations(allocations);
```

## Output Example

```
Full Kelly Allocation (Optimal Growth):
------------------------------------
NVDA: 32.31% ($323.06)
MELI: 24.43% ($244.26)
SHOP: 17.23% ($172.32)
CPNG: 14.96% ($149.59)
TSLA: 11.08% ($110.77)
Total: 100.00%

Half Kelly Allocation (Recommended for More Stability):
------------------------------------
NVDA: 16.15% ($161.53) + Cash: 10.00% ($100.00)
MELI: 12.21% ($122.13) + Cash: 10.00% ($100.00)
SHOP: 8.62% ($86.16) + Cash: 10.00% ($100.00)
CPNG: 7.48% ($74.79) + Cash: 10.00% ($100.00)
TSLA: 5.54% ($55.38) + Cash: 10.00% ($100.00)
Total: 100.00%
```

## Important Notes

1. The Kelly Criterion is highly sensitive to input parameters, especially expected returns.
2. Full Kelly can lead to significant drawdowns. Many practitioners use fractional Kelly strategies:
   - Three-Quarter Kelly (75%): Balance between growth and security
   - Half Kelly (50%): Commonly used balance of risk and return
   - Quarter Kelly (25%): Very conservative approach
3. The advanced implementation requires matrix operations, which is why `mathjs` is recommended.
4. These are theoretical allocations and should be combined with your own risk management strategy.
5. The visualization functions require a browser environment and a library like Chart.js.

## Dependencies (for full functionality)

- mathjs: For matrix operations in the advanced implementation
- chart.js: For visualization in a browser environment

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. For full functionality, install dependencies:
```
npm install mathjs chart.js
```

## Running the Demo

```
node index.js
```

## Extending the Code

- Add functionality to fetch real historical data from financial APIs
- Implement more sophisticated return estimation methods
- Create a web interface for interactive portfolio allocation
- Add support for additional asset classes beyond stocks

## Historical Data Feature

This toolkit includes a feature to calculate volatility and expected returns based on actual historical price data. To use this feature:

1. Through the web interface:
   - Navigate to the Stock Settings page 
   - Click the "Update from Historical Data" button
   - The application will fetch the last 5 years of price data from Yahoo Finance 
   - Volatility and expected returns will be calculated based on this real data

2. From the command line:
   ```
   npm run update-data
   ```
   or specify certain stocks:
   ```
   npm run update-data AAPL MSFT GOOG
   ```

The historical data functionality:
- Uses 5 years of daily price data (when available)
- Calculates annualized volatility from daily price movements
- Calculates expected returns based on historical performance, with some adjustments to be more forward-looking
- Caches the price data for 7 days to minimize external API requests
